                    <p class='lead'>I am a web / graphic designer, gamer, and currently am working
                        in research.  I love to make websites and graphics / pictures
                        for others Twitch or YouTube accounts.  You can check out
                        all my work in the Twitch and YouTube Portfolio.  Also check
                        out the Services and Request Form tabs on the side.

                        I am an avid gamer on Xbox One and PS4.  I do like the major
                        games that come out, but I'd also like to think I like the 
                        little guys as well.  Playing games that give unique experiences
                        that not many other titles out there have is definitely an
                        enjoyable experience.
